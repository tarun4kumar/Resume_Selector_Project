# Resume_Selector_Project
"Explore this Python project for classifying resumes based on relevance using Naive Bayes. Find code for data cleaning, visualization, and model training." 

This project explores a machine learning approach to classifying resumes based on their relevance to a specific job description or criteria. The objective is to develop a model that can automatically identify potentially irrelevant resumes (flagged) and categorize relevant ones (not flagged).
